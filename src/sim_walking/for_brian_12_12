walk_06_01_completewalk has a full walking trial. This is 3 right steps and 2 left steps total
walk_06_01_fullsteps has two full steps. By full steps I mean their leg was behind their body and it swings fully forward unlike the firs step we take.
walk_06_01_rightleg_halfstep just has the first step the suject takes. This is a half step because it comes from a resting position where both legs are straight and aligned with the body. I only got the right leg because now that I think about it, both leg dmps could be trained with one side since legs should be symmetrical.
