Potential Approach

We can rerun SACSegmentation for each best line by removing previous line and finding next best segment.

We only care about a specific scan area from the lidar, from straight downwards to directly in front (e.g. -90 degrees to 0 degrees on XZ plane), as that is all we need to detect stair features. PointCloudXYZ data items 45 to 135.

Plan:

- Run RANSAC multiple times
- Concatenate segment clusters
- Somehow identify which are horizontal stair platforms
- Find difference in Z between clusters for approximate stair height
- Same with depth
